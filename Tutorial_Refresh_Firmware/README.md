If you have customized your own keymapping but found it not useful and want to start all over again. You can try to refresh the firmware so that the keymapping will be set as default.

Here are the steps for the refresh.

Hold the “endcall” button and connect the keyboard to your windows PC, the chip will be entering the bootloader mode.

You will see a storage device found by the computer like this:

Then drage the firmware (which you can download on my github page) into the storage disk.

Then the firmware is already burnt into the chip. The keymapping will be set as default.
